# Shawna Jacques' MITxPro/Emeritus Portfolio and Workspace (2021-2022)  

## Part 1: Foundational Skills in Web Development with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS  

### This is where I am doing my work and creating my portfolio through the Full-Stack Web Development course I'm enrolled in through MITxPRO and Emeritus. To see the website version, please visit https://theweather.github.io/.  
 
### Installation: There are currently no installation instructions needed to run this project, beyond:
1. Downloading and maintaining file structure as-is.
2. Opening the developer tools in Google Chrome (Google Chrome is the rceommended browser for this project.)  
  
### Right now, there isn't much practical use for this project outside of the scope of my studies. I hope to increase the value as time moves forward.  

### For support, please feel free to contact me on Twitter, at https://www.twitter.com/codewitchy .  

### The Roadmap for this repository mostly follows that laid out by the course I'm taking through MITxPRO and Emeritus.
