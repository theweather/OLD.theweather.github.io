<h1>Explain how objects are stored in memory while a code is being executed</h1>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<br>
Create your own real-world mental model of a computer using analogies for the CPU, stack, heap, machine instructions, and input and output. 
<blockquote>
Input: A costumer selects a Jedi costume from Star Wars to make.

CPU: The costumer sees that the current item they are making is a Jedi outer tunic.

Machine Instructions: Small individual steps for the costumer to follow to get ready to take to the sewing machine to sew the tunic.
Such as:

Measure the person who will be wearing the costume.
Create the tunic pattern based on the personâ€™s measurements.
Wash and dry the fabric.
Mark out the pieces or pin the pattern to the fabric so the grain goes the right way and space is used effectively.
Cut out the pieces.
Pin the pieces together correctly.
Stack: The process by which the costumer prepares the tunic to be sewn. The pieces cannot be pinned before the person who will be wearing the costume is measured to make the pattern. Pinning the pattern to the fabric involves steps thinking about the drape of the fabric for each piece. Different parts of the process take different amounts of time and must go in a certain order.

Heap: Where the fabric and sewing supplies are stored, like shelves, drawers, racks, etc. Scissors and pins are probably in a drawer or a box, whereas fabric is probably in bins or on shelves.

Output: The pinned tunic, ready to be sewn on the sewing machine.
